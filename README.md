# **MONSTER JOBS - JOB APP FOR MONSTERS - ADA ITW**

Deploy link: 

MONSTER JOBS allows the person responsible for updating the Web to mantain the APP by posting, editing and deleting jobs as needed.

Project developed as an assignment for the Frontend Developement Course at ADA ITW to learn about Asinchronism. I used the following technologies and frameworks: 
HTML5
Tailwind for CSS
Javascript
Font Awesome versi√≥n 6.4.0
Mockapi
